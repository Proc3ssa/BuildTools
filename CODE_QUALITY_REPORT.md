# Code Quality Report

## ðŸ§ª Initial Linting Results

When ESLint was first run, it reported the following:

- 8 total issues
- 3 `no-console` warnings
- 5 `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` errors

---

## âœ… Fixes Made

- Removed all `console.log` calls except where allowed in development
- Replaced all `any` types with explicit types
- Auto-formatted all files using Prettier
- Integrated `eslint-plugin-prettier` for live formatting errors

---

## ðŸ“¦ Automation

- `npm run check` ensures lint + format pass
- Husky pre-commit hook added to block bad commits
